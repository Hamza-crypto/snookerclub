        <p>Being a pool and snooker fan for a long time, I wanted to see one day my country reach the standards of the professional level. For that, I decided to launch a management project for these two sports at the national level. <br><br> Before starting, I needed a person who understands very well all the problems that these sports encounter, more precisely a professional player. After some research, I come across Jouad Tabit; world team champion in 2014, African team champion in 2017 and one of the best players at the national level.
            <br><br>
            A very enriching first meeting with Jaoud. A week later, Jaoud asked me for a second meeting with him and Salah Eddine Bazi. After a long discussion, the three of us decided to embark on this adventure and start this project which will boost the image of these sports in Morocco.
